Double Uni Knot

How to tie the Double Uni Knot. This knot is used by anglers in both salt and fresh water for joining lines of similar or different strengths. Bass fishing legend Roland Martin considers the Double Uni the best knot for tying braided line to a fluorocarbon or monofilament leader. It works well and some find it easier to tie than the Blood Knot. When tying in braided line to mono or fluoro, make 6 to 8 turns with the slippery braided line and 5+ turns with the mono (depending on its thickness - less with heavier line). The Double Uni Knot is one of 12 great fishing knots included on the Pro-Knot Fishing Knot Cards (click to see).

Double Uni Knot Tying Instructions
Overlap the ends of lines to be joined. Take the end of the line from the left and double back and make 3 to 4 wraps around both lines and through the loop that was formed. Pull tag end to tighten.

Repeat with the end of the line on the left making the same number of wraps unless tying with braided line in which you should double the number of wraps.

You have now tied two Uni knots. Pull the standing lines in opposite direction to slide the two knots together.
