Improved Clinch Knot
How to tie the Improved Clinch Knot. The Improved Clinch Knot is a time-tested and a very popular choice for tying terminal tackle to monofilament line. This "improved" version of the good old Clinch Knot has become so popular that most fishermen have forgotten about the regular Clinch (check out its page - linked above - to learn more and decide which version is right for you). The improved version is also quick and easy to tie and reliable. It can be difficult to tie in lines testing greater than 25 pounds breaking strength. It is not recommended for braided line. The Improved Clinch Knot is one of 12 great fishing knots included on the Pro-Knot Fishing Knot Cards (click to see).

Improved Clinch Knot Tying Instructions
Thread end of line through eye of hook. Double back making 5 or more turns around standing line.

Bring end of line back through the first loop formed behind the eye then through the big loop.

Wet knot and pull on tag end to tighten down the coils. Slide tight against the eye and clip tag end close.
 

Please note that our animated Improved Clinch Knot below shows the knot finishing with the tag end at the back of the knot but in reality the tag end will be at the front by the eye.
